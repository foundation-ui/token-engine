## Notes

### (31/02/2025)

- Might be a good idea to explore how the same implementation could be done using another provider.
  S2 handles a lot of thing but it looks like the machinery is too big for what FUI_ENGINES project requires.

### (01/03/2025)

- Lot of features indeed, lots and rabbit holes also. Don't like that a lot but i'm going to roll with it for now.
  Let's follow that rule: If there are further more obstacles due to S2 itself, i'll switch provider.
