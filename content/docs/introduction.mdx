## Foundation Design System

`@foundation-ui/design-system` is a React Design System built to generate and use low-level UI foundations, bringing cohesion throughout your Libraries and User Interfaces along the way.
Foundation is divided into three distinct packages, each serving a specific purpose and allowing you to include only the dependencies you need.

  `@foundation-ui/core` is a Design Tokens System built to bring frictionless
  cohesion across apps. Use it coupled with `@foundation-ui/tokens` and
  `@foundation-ui/components` or as a standalone package to customize your own
  Design Tokens System.
